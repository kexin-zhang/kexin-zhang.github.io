I'm currently at [Pinterest](www.pinterest.com). I graduated from [Georgia Tech](http://www.gatech.edu/) in December 2018, with a degree in industrial engineering, concentration in operations research, and a minor in computer science, concentration in artificial intelligence. I like writing code (especially for analytics/data vis), bouldering, making playlists, and listening to podcasts.

In the past, I've interned at [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/) and [Wayfair](https://www.wayfair.com/). I also have experience as the Director of Technology for [HackGT](https://hack.gt), a teaching assistant for CS 2110 (Computer Organization and Programming), and an undergraduate research assistant in Georgia Tech's [comp.social lab](http://comp.social.gatech.edu/).
