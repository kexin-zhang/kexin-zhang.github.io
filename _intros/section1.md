Welcome to my internet home! I'm a third year at [Georgia Tech](http://www.gatech.edu/){:target="_blank"}, majoring in industrial engineering, with a concentration in operations research, and minoring in computer science. My interests revolve around analytics (especially data vis!), data science, and software development.

I am currently serving as the Director of Technology for [HackGT](https://hack.gt){:target="_blank"} and instructing Georgia Tech students as a teaching assistant for CS 2110 (Computer Organization and Programming). This past summer, I interned at [Wayfair](https://www.wayfair.com/){:target="_blank"} on the business intelligence infrastructure team. My previous experience includes undergradute research in Georgia Tech's [comp.social lab](http://comp.social.gatech.edu/){:target="_blank"} and full stack web development at fintech startup [Stackfolio](http://home.stackfolio.com/){:target="_blank"}.
