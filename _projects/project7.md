Project for [CSE 6242: Data & Visual Analytics](http://poloclub.gatech.edu/cse6242/2017fall/){:target="_blank"}.

For CSE 6242, my group created a web app to visualize differences in price, review sentiment, and location for Airbnb and hotel options in New York City. I also wrote a [blog post](/2017/12/23/airbnb-vs-hotels.html) detailing some of the motivation and work behind this project.
