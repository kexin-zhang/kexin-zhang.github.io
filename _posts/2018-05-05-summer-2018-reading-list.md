At the beginning of every break, I always have these lofty goals of reading a ton of books. It usually works out pretty well initially -- I'll speed through a couple books within the first few weeks. But I have trouble in keeping up with consistently reading, and I'm hoping that this break will be different.

Here's my summer reading list: 
1. The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle - Haruki Murakami
2. The Trial - Franz Kafka
3. The Book of Laughter and Forgetting - Milan Kundera
4. The Five Dysfunctions of a Team - Patrick Lencioni
5. Intercourse - Andrew Dworkin
6. In Cold Blood - Truman Capote

I will (hopefully) be adding to this post with updates throughout the summer.
