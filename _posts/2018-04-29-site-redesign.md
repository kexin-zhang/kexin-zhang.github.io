This week is Georgia Tech's finals week, and I had an urge to redesign my personal website. I'm a fan of procrastinating by putting off important, urgent tasks to do mildly productive, not important things. Which is why I'm simultaneously rewritting my site CSS and this blog post and (barely) skimming lecture notes for my final tomorrow. *This is fine.*

I've been wanting to move this site into a more minamalist, black/white kind of direction. Before, I had this purple gradient background on the first page, and I was starting to not like it. (Side note: if you like artsy gradients, I really like looking at this [website](https://uigradients.com){:target="blank"}). Unfortunately, I also know basically nothing about design, so redoing this website is challenging. 

This site is built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/){:target="blank"}, a static site generator. It's a straightforward and cool way to blog/generate content without building your own CRM. Jekyll has some built-in themes that you can choose from, or you can create your own custom pages -- which is what I've opted to do from the beginning. For this new version of the site, I'm basically redoing all of the page layouts with [SkeletonCSS](http://getskeleton.com/){:target="blank"}, a lightweight CSS framework, and some custom styling written by yours truly.
