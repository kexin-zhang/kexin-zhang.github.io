I did research for a couple semesters in the [social computing lab](http://comp.social.gatech.edu/), studying how people interact on the internet. One of the research projects I worked on turned into a paper, which was accepted as an interactive poster submission to [CSCW 2018](https://cscw.acm.org/2018/)! For this project, I wrote a Chrome extension to add visual cues to Twitter to (1) draw attention to mainstream news items with questions in the comments, with the goal of encouraging users to investigate and reflect on the news items, and (2) draw attention away from untrustworthy news sources. The overall goal for the plugin was to promote news literacy and active reading of current events on Twitter. You can find the extended abstract [here](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3274056).
